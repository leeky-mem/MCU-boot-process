MCU Boot process:
https://embeddedinventor.com/embedded-bootloader-and-booting-process-explained/
	0. Reset code
		only thing that MCU remembers when power off. usually single instruction that gives controll to the next stage which is usually hardware init
	1. Hardware init
		MCU does not remember what peripherals it has. hardware init initializes everything that is needed to boot the mcu
	2. decision: Bootlaoder mode or application mode
		bootloader mode on PC -> BIOS or UEFI to configure the system (Boot drive, clock speeds and so on)
		bootloader mode on embedded device -> very simple, setupt some default options for application, reflash application during development, software update after release
	3. Startup code
		allocate space and copy all global variables to ram
		init stack and stackpointer
		init heap
		call main
	4. OS Starting Process(optional)
		all other needed driver are loaded to give a fully functioning system (In embedded OS same thing but different periferals)(in bare metal this is done in main())
