**ECTS**: 3 (90 hours)

In this EVA I would like to research the different boot processes on micro controller systems.
I want to get a detailed understanding on how the MCU systems I mostly work with boot. 
Namely I want to understand and document the differences in the boot process on a bare metal application compare the one with the Zephyr RTOS.
Further I want to understand and document in detail, how secure boot works and how different hardware providers implement it.

## MUST

- Understand and document the boot process on bare metal and Zephyr RTOS systems
- Understand and document the secure boot process for bare metal and Zephyr RTOS systems
- Compare how secure boot is implemented for different vendors like Nordic Semiconductors, STMicrocontrollers and NXP

## MAY

- Implement a secure boot application on at least two different hardware platforms from different vendors
- Compare boot times for secure boot and insecure boot on the same hardware platform
