# Boot process on MCU system
This repository contains a report I made for my masters and the relevant example code which was used to create the report.
The report explains the boot process on MCU systems for bare metal application. It is meant as reading material for everyone who wants to unerstand the boot process in detail, but I worte it to learn that process myself.

See the [scope](scope.md) section for a more detaild describtion of the content.

Find the final report that was handed in for grading in the [realese](https://github.com/leeky-mem/MCU-boot-process/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section.
